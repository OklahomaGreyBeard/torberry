#summary Torberry main info

= Introduction =
Torberry is a raspbian based Linux distribution ready to serve as a transparent proxy and DNS server.

= Details =
Main features:
 * Raspbian based
 * includes minimal packages + tor + tor-arm + dropbear

= Installation =
Torberry is installed as usual in Raspberry. You can read [http://code.google.com/p/torberry/wiki/Installation installation instructions]

= Current bugs =
DHCP is a must, if torberry node is not able to get an IP from a dhcp server it will hang forever. It will be corrected soon.

= Clients configuration =
Client configuratiÃ³n must be done manually. Two things that you have to change are gateway and dns servers. Both must be configured with raspberry's IP.

In Linux you can:
{{{
route delete default gateway [your.current.gateway]
route add default gateway [ip.of.raspberry]
echo "nameserver [ip.of.raspberry]" > /etc/resolv.conf
}}}

= Protocols unsupported =
As this is basically a transparent + DNS proxy, there are network protocols that wont work as you would expect in a gateway.

*ICMP* is not supported by tor.
*UDP* is not supported by tor.
